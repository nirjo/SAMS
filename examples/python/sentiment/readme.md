# Sentiment Analysis

> Sentiment analysis as a service.

This project provides a hosted API for [VADER Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) by [cjhutto](https://github.com/cjhutto).

**We set aside the majority of any revenue generated from this API for the original OSS developers**. If you are one of these devs, please check out our [mission](https://saasify.sh/#/mission) and [get in touch](https://saasify.sh/#/support) to setup payouts and answer any questions you may have.
