# Hello World with Coupons

This is a very simple Saasify project that extends the basic hello world example with support for coupons.

Saasify coupons follow the same format as [Stripe coupons](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts). The only difference is that you are not allowed to specify an `id` at the moment due to coupon codes needing to be unique among all projects and deployments.
